He said he ran out of time \u201cnecessary to mount a winning campaign\u201d while mourning the loss of his son, Beau, to cancer.\n\nHe instead spent 2016 campaigning for Hillary Clinton.\n\nBiden spoke publicly before the election about his post-White House plans, which include working on his cancer moonshot initiative, a possible policy project with a major university and writing a book.\n\nThe vice president was at the Capitol on Monday afternoon to preside over the Senate as it held a vote on legislation funding the cancer initiative, a portion of which the chamber named after Beau.\n\nBiden received an emotional tribute from his colleagues on the Senate floor. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the bill was a \u201ctestament to [Biden\u2019s] tremendous effort\u201d to fight cancer.\n\nHe would have to put that work aside if he decided to launch a presidential bid in four years.\n\nBut since Clinton lost, the future of the Democratic Party is up for grabs. Some party officials have wondered if a candidate like Biden or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who ran a competitive primary campaign against Clinton, would have fared better against President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nThe vice president has long had his eye on the Oval Office. He ran for president in 1988 and again in 2008, losing both times in his party\u2019s primary.\n\nIn the past few months, he has repeatedly refused to rule out a future run for office. He told CNN in October his decision not to run in 2016 was solely because of his son\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t run for one simple overarching reason. My son was dying and he died,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI didn\u2019t not run because Hillary\u2019s running. I didn\u2019t run because my son\u2019s not here.\u201d", "images": ["https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/biden.joe_.1122.jpg?w=1280", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/themes/the-hill/assets/thehill-logo-footer.png", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/rising-card-hostnames.jpg?w=320&h=180&crop=1", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/themes/the-hill/assets/the-hill-logo-horizontal.svg", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/rising-card-hostnames-1.jpg?w=640&h=360&crop=1", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/themes/the-hill/assets/mobile_download_badge_ios.png", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/7696394543cf45d7ad0d4658e1c96282.jpg?w=360&h=180&crop=1", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/mediacrew_040423_getty_trump-media.jpg?w=320&h=180&crop=1", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/students_gun-control_protest_tn_040623ap_wedge-issues.jpeg?w=320&h=180&crop=1", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/d0be92510ee3481ab7668316baa2bf6d-e1676069883457.jpg?w=320&h=180&crop=1", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/boebertlauren_031023ag02_w.jpg?w=320&h=180&crop=1", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/trumpdonald_040423upi07_w.jpg?w=320&h=180&crop=1", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/themes/the-hill/assets/mobile_download_badge_android.png"], "top_img": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/biden.joe_.1122.jpg?w=1280", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jordan Fabian", "Hours Ago", "Am Et", "Day Ago", "Days Ago"], "canonical_link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/308895-biden-raises-possibility-of-2020-presidential-bid/", "title": "Biden raises possibility of 2020 presidential bid", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Vice President Biden\u00a0on Monday\u00a0raised the possibility of a presidential bid in 2020.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI am going to run in 2020,\u201d Biden told a group of reporters in the Capitol when asked about his political future. \u201cWhat the hell man, anyway.\u201d \u00a0 #bidenwatchbegins?
