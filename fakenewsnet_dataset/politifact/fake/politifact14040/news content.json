I\u2019m actually the biggest proponent of not doing it.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has faced criticism for refusing to release his tax returns.\n\nHe has repeatedly pushed back against calls to release the documents, saying he is under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe IRS has said nothing prevents Trump from releasing his tax returns.\n\nEric Trump said on Wednesday that there is \u201cno tax attorney in the world who will tell you to release your tax returns while you\u2019re under a standard routine audit.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cYou don\u2019t learn that much from a tax return.\n\n\u201cYou learn a lot more when you look at somebody\u2019s assets. You know how many hotels we have around the world. You know how many golf courses we have around the world. You know every single building we have.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton last summer released her tax returns from 2007 to 2015, and this month she released her 2015 returns. Her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), also released 10 years of returns this month.\n\nTrump\u2019s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, has also said he plans to release his tax returns.\n\nDemocrats have seized on Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to release the documents. Clinton has hit Trump on the issue several times in the past, and her campaign released an ad earlier this month highlighting past remarks by the GOP nominee saying he would release his returns.", "images": ["https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/07/trumperic_072016gn2.jpg?w=1280", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/d0be92510ee3481ab7668316baa2bf6d-e1676069883457.jpg?w=320&h=180&crop=1", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/themes/the-hill/assets/thehill-logo-footer.png", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/rising-card-hostnames.jpg?w=320&h=180&crop=1", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/rising-card-hostnames-1.jpg?w=640&h=360&crop=1", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/themes/the-hill/assets/the-hill-logo-horizontal.svg", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/themes/the-hill/assets/mobile_download_badge_ios.png", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/7696394543cf45d7ad0d4658e1c96282.jpg?w=360&h=180&crop=1", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/mediacrew_040423_getty_trump-media.jpg?w=320&h=180&crop=1", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/students_gun-control_protest_tn_040623ap_wedge-issues.jpeg?w=320&h=180&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/07/trumperic_072016gn2.jpg?w=2000&ssl=1", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/boebertlauren_031023ag02_w.jpg?w=320&h=180&crop=1", "https://thehill.com/wp-content/themes/the-hill/assets/mobile_download_badge_android.png"], "top_img": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/07/trumperic_072016gn2.jpg?w=1280", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca Savransky", "Am Et", "Hours Ago", "Day Ago", "Days Ago"], "canonical_link": "https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/292495-eric-trump-it-would-be-foolish-for-father-to-release-tax/", "title": "Eric Trump: It would be \u2018foolish\u2019 for my dad to release tax returns", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "<p>\u201cYou would have a bunch of people who know nothing about taxes trying to look through.\"</p>", "dcterms.type": "Text", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "Eric Trump: It would be \u2018foolish\u2019 for my dad to release tax returns", "dcterms.creator": "Rebecca Savransky", "dcterms.description": "\u201cYou would have a bunch of people who know nothing about taxes trying to look through.\"", "dcterms.date": "2016-08-24T12:31:21-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/292495-eric-trump-it-would-be-foolish-for-father-to-release-tax/", "generator": "WordPress 6.1.1", "sailthru.date": "2016-08-24 12:31:21", "sailthru.title": "Eric Trump: It would be \u2018foolish\u2019 for my dad to release tax returns", "sailthru.author": "Rebecca Savransky", "sailthru.description": "<p>\u201cYou would have a bunch of people who know nothing about taxes trying to look through.\"</p>", "sailthru.image.full": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/07/trumperic_072016gn2.jpg?strip=1", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/07/trumperic_072016gn2.jpg?w=50", "og": {"title": "Eric Trump: It would be \u2018foolish\u2019 for my dad to release tax returns", "url": "https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/292495-eric-trump-it-would-be-foolish-for-father-to-release-tax/", "description": "\u201cYou would have a bunch of people who know nothing about taxes trying to look through.\u201d", "site_name": "The Hill", "image": {"identifier": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/07/trumperic_072016gn2.jpg?w=1280", "secure_url": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/07/trumperic_072016gn2.jpg?w=1280"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-08-24T16:31:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-08-24T17:05:12+00:00", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cYou would have a bunch of people who know nothing about taxes trying to look through.\u201d", "title": "Eric Trump: It would be \u2018foolish\u2019 for my dad to release tax returns", "text": {"title": "Eric Trump: It would be \u2018foolish\u2019 for my dad to release tax returns"}, "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/07/trumperic_072016gn2.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/cropped-favicon-512px-1.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1472056281.0, "source": "http://thehill.com", "summary": ""}
