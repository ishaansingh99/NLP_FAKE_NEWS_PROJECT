PAUL, Minn. - The remarks, as prepared for delivery, of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in her address to the 2008 Republican National Convention accepting the party\u2019s vice presidential nomination.\n\nMr. Chairman, delegates, and fellow citizens: I am honored to be considered for the nomination for Vice President of the United States...\n\nI accept the call to help our nominee for president to serve and defend America.\n\nStory continues below \u2193 advertisement advertisement\n\nI accept the challenge of a tough fight in this election... against confident opponents ... at a crucial hour for our country.\n\nAnd I accept the privilege of serving with a man who has come through much harder missions ... and met far graver challenges ... and knows how tough fights are won - the next president of the United States, John S. McCain.\n\nIt was just a year ago when all the experts in Washington counted out our nominee because he refused to hedge his commitment to the security of the country he loves.\n\nWith their usual certitude, they told us that all was lost - there was no hope for this candidate who said that he would rather lose an election than see his country lose a war.\n\nBut the pollsters and pundits overlooked just one thing when they wrote him off.\n\nThey overlooked the caliber of the man himself - the determination, resolve, and sheer guts of Senator John McCain. The voters knew better.\n\nAnd maybe that's because they realize there is a time for politics and a time for leadership ... a time to campaign and a time to put our country first.\n\nOur nominee for president is a true profile in courage, and people like that are hard to come by.\n\nHe's a man who wore the uniform of this country for 22 years, and refused to break faith with those troops in Iraq who have now brought victory within sight.\n\nAnd as the mother of one of those troops, that is exactly the kind of man I want as commander in chief. I'm just one of many moms who'll say an extra prayer each night for our sons and daughters going into harm's way.\n\nOur son Track is 19.\n\nAnd one week from tomorrow - September 11th - he'll deploy to Iraq with the Army infantry in the service of his country.\n\nMy nephew Kasey also enlisted, and serves on a carrier in the Persian Gulf.\n\nMy family is proud of both of them and of all the fine men and women serving the country in uniform. Track is the eldest of our five children.\n\nIn our family, it's two boys and three girls in between - my strong and kind-hearted daughters Bristol, Willow, and Piper.\n\nAnd in April, my husband Todd and I welcomed our littlest one into the world, a perfectly beautiful baby boy named Trig. From the inside, no family ever seems typical.\n\nThat's how it is with us.\n\nOur family has the same ups and downs as any other ... the same challenges and the same joys.\n\nSometimes even the greatest joys bring challenge.\n\nAnd children with special needs inspire a special love.\n\nTo the families of special-needs children all across this country, I have a message: For years, you sought to make America a more welcoming place for your sons and daughters.\n\nI pledge to you that if we are elected, you will have a friend and advocate in the White House.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://stb.msn.com/i/48/86F1396496DFE1BAD68AB5F28409.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/Components/ArtAndPhoto-Fronts/SITEWIDE/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://msnbcmedia1.msn.com/i/msnbc/Components/Sources/Art/APTRANS.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://c.msn.com/c.gif?NC=1255&NA=1154&PS=69718&PI=7329&DI=305&TP=http%3a%2f%2fmsnbc.msn.com%2fid%2f26535811%2f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://msnbcmedia2.msn.com/i/msnbc/Components/ColorBoxes/Styles/img/video_icon_v2.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://msnbcmedia1.msn.com/i/msnbc/Components/ColorBoxes/Styles/img/photo_icon_v2.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://msnbcmedia3.msn.com/j/msnbc/Components/Slideshows/_production/ss-080903-RNC-day3/ss-0809803-rnc-day3-tease-8p.vsmall.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://view.atdmt.com/MON/view/msnnkmon0950000211mon/direct/01/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://msnbcmedia1.msn.com/j/msnbc/Sections/NEWS/A_World News/z_Gut_Check/Gut_Check_Battleground_Economics/TZ_Wide_BattlegroundEcon.300w.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://msnbcmedia3.msn.com/j/msnbc/Components/Video/080903/n_rnc_palinspeech_080903.thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/Components/Art/exclamation.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://msnbcom.112.2o7.net/b/ss/msnbcom/1/H.15.1--NS/0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://msnbcmedia3.msn.com/i/msnbc/Components/ArtAndPhoto-Fronts/Grid-Promos/Conventions08/TheConventionsLabels/Rep-logo2.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/images/buttons/next/buttonNext.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://stb.msn.com/i/B6/32E46DE281A68B9C33FC582D2569D.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/images/icons/slideshow.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://stb.msn.com/i/48/6CDE404B4BFEC334D023E5422081E0.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://stb.msn.com/i/78/7CE57843948D6DF13E79A2DE4E15C.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/Components/CSS/img/spacer.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://msnbcmedia3.msn.com/j/msnbc/Components/Photo/_new/080903-sarah-palin-hlarge-825p.hlarge.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080904093322im_/http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/Components/ArtAndPhoto-Fronts/SITEWIDE/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Transcript of Palin acceptance speech", "meta_data": {"description": "The remarks, as prepared for delivery, of Alaska Gov.
