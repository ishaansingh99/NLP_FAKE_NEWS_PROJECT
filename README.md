## Code Implementation

Maintain all Python code that you develop for your project in this repository.

You can use _any_ packages that come as default option with Anaconda, TensorFlow or PyTorch. We need to be able to run your implementation on our machines. So, be sure to get approval from us for any special packages! It we cannot run the code, you will lose a significant number of points.

Your final code submission should include:

* **README.md** - follow the template available [here](https://github.com/catiaspsilva/README-template).This file should include information about library requirements and instructions for running your code.

* **Python scripts** - python script/s or Jupyter Notebook/s to implement your experiments and ideas. Code should be running (free of errors or bugs), well documented, clean of clutter (remove anything not needed).
  * If you are training and testing a model, create two files: a training file and a test file.
